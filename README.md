# PathfinderAssistant

### Description
This app is designed to assist with the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game, specifically the Wrath of the Righteous expansion.
Allows for the user to create a character within the parameters of the game, and adjust that character's details for reference purposes.
All data stored locally in a SQLite database.

Primary sources for data include: 

https://pacg.fandom.com/wiki/Pathfinder_Adventure_Card_Game_Wiki
https://paizo.com/products/btpy9a46


### What I accomplished in this project:

* Developed an application entirely in Kotlin.
* Designed a UI that adjusts dynamically to be visually appealing on devices of varying size.
* Saved data in a local SQLite database across multiple tables.
* Included helper activities accessible via custom menu icon, to assist with tracking cards or rolling dice.
* Allowed for users to fully customize characters within the bounds of the game, via spinners.
* Provided seperate Activities for viewing and editing characters, for ease of digesting information.
